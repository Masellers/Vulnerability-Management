# Vulnerability-Management

In this Project, we will use Tenable Nessus to scan a vulnerable system and talk about the remediation process. We will use what we find to create a report for our client on what we our results. Sometimes clients may non-technical and will not understand much about IT or security. We will report the vulnerabilities, the remediations, why this matters and break this down and communicate these things in a understandable way.

This project will not cover and assumes that you are able to download & install OracleBox, Nessus and Metasploitable 2


# Systems Used

### Tenable Nessus
Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner. We will be using [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) for this project which can be used for free.

### Metasploitable 2
Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerably operating system usually used for practicing exploiting an OS. We will be using in the context of a blue team where we scan it for vulnerabilities and remedy them. Metasploitable can be downloaded [Here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)


# **Step 1: Run Metasploitable and Login**

### Login
After starting, the metasploitable VM will prompt us to login. The default credentials are `msfadmin/msfadmin`. 

### Aquire IP Address
To learn our IP adress, we can use the command `ifconfig`, since we are using linux and `ipconfig` if we were using windows. Our IP address is the one labeled `inet addr:192.168.56.101`. This is what it is here but the actual ip address will most likely look different on your machine. 

We can also type this address into our web browser to see a screen that looks like this:

# **Step 2: Setup Unauthenticated Scan**

### Unauthenticated Basic Network Scan
In our Nessus application, we will press "New Scan" in the top right corner. Under the section labeled "Vulnerabilities" select "Basic Network Scan".  From this page we will enter our scan's information.
* Make sure to give the scan an appropriate name so that we can easily identify it later.
* Use the IP address we aquired in the previous step in the box labeled "Targets"
* Launch the scan

# **Step 3: Setup Authenticated Scan**

### Authenticated Basic Network Scan
This scan will be setup exactly the same way as the previous scan. Additionally, we will navigate to the "Credentials" tab and see two options: SSH & Windows. 

Since Metasploitable is a linux OS we will select SSH. Change the Authentication method to "password" and use the credentials `msfadmin/msfadmin`. we can leave the rest of the setting as default and launch our scan.

# **Step 5: Remediate Vulnerabilities**

### Remediations
Most of the vulnerabilities discovered in our scan can simply be remediated by ensuring that we are updating our system regularly. Metasploitable is based on Ubunto Linux and the method for updating on Ubuntu uses the simply Terminal commands `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`. If we were using windows, we could navigate to the update manager using the start menu and run our updates from there.
